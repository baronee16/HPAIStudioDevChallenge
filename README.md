# Descriptions

<a id=first-course> </a>

## 1. Using AI Studio features in 6 steps 
Within the ai-studio fundamentals folder you can find examples of various of basic experiments to help familiarize you with AI Studio. 

The notebooks contained within the ai_studio fundamentals folder include:
  * Iris classification: One of the most traditional examples in ML, this notebook can be used to illustrate the most simple usage of AI Studio (section 1)
  * Movie experiment: This notebook is an example of a recommendation system, which can be used to show features as Data Fabric, ML Flow and Tensorboard monitoring and model deployment.
  * Tale of two cities: This is a nice example for different data visualization techniques. It can also be used to demonstrate data fabric and installation of libraries/customization of environments
  * MNIST classification: End-to-end introdutory example of Computer Vision with AI Studio
  * Spam Classification: End-to-end introdutory example of Natural Language Processing with AI Studio
