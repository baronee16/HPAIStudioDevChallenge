# Description

In this folder, we have 5 different experiments, to illustrate different aspects of Data Science and Machine Learning using AI Studio. In order to run the experiments in this folder, specific resources need to be installed.

## Resources

For these experiments:

 1. You will need to create or use a preexiting project. If you are new to AI Studio, you may want to create a new dedicated project as a best practice for your learning. Using a dedicated project will help you understand the layout and use of AI Studio. 
 1. There are different options for workspaces. Each workspace has a basic set of starting libraries within it. Part of the magic of AI Studio is you can start with libraries already configured for your needs. 
 This will enable you to get right to work on your Data Science experiments. The notebooks in this folder require Data Science or Deep Learning workspaces, as specified below. Also, most of the experiments require adding the asset [s3://dsp-demo-bucket/tutorial_data/] as a dataset called **tutorial **
